This introduces v2 of seshat which is full of breaking changes.
Primary things:
	- Renaming of BaseController to Controller
		- BaseRequest -> Request
	- Addition of headers, RequestHeaders and ResponseHeaders
			and several other header classes to be used within those.
	- Addition of Response class which is what every controller has to return to
			dispatch with now
	- Moving of several fields around and condensing the route stuff
	- Rewrite router to use regex and allows the route decorator now allows for
			custom routes if need be with url structures like:
				/user/:name/:email or something similar
	- Request.id no longer exists, but Request.url_params will often have an id
			field in it, or in the case of the above url: {"name": thing1, "email":
			thing2}.
	- Renamed Controller._build() to Controller.__call__()
	- Rework how actions work behind the scenes
Other new things:
	- Moved error catching out of the route_table, and into error_catcher.
	- Use of a lot of __call__ features across most objects.
	- Hopefully better handling of unicode within everything (headers and such
			are going to have problems however, until I get around to reading all the
			specs)

Things which will come later on:
	- HTTP Digest handling.
	- Cookie handling
	- Session handling (ties in with cookies and will provide a hopefully simple
			interface to get and set and save sessions)
	- More better tests
	- Better Docs (heh... yeah right)
